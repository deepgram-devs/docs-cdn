# Docs CDN

This repository is to act as CDN via jsdeliver for the doc sites remote stylesheets and scripts.

## Docs Site

The docs site is currently viewable in preview at https://api-beta-deepgram.readme.io/

## CSS

Customising the CSS is done by making styles with a higher specificity than the default styling. 
Readme provides a wide selection of CSS variables, but overriding class styling is acceptable 
where necessary. Please Readme's docs on [customizing docs using CSS variables](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/customizing-docs-using-css-variables)
